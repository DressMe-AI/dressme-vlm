Describe the clothing item clearly and naturally, using short descriptive phrases or sentence fragments. Focus on what it looks like (color, pattern, fit), how it feels (material, weight), when itâ€™s best worn (season or weather), what kind of work setting or day it suits (e.g., casual Friday, presentation, chilly morning), and what it pairs well with (like pants, skirts, or layers). Mention any standout features like neckline, cut, or details.
Keep the language simple and concise, like a person jotting this down in a style app. Just return the description, no formatting or bullet points.

Example 1 (top):
Flowy shirt. Great for warm summer, spring or fall days. Goes great with jeans for a casual look, or with black pants for a more dressy look. Striped pattern. Blue, white, and orange.

Example 2 (bottom):
Ripped jeans. Loose fitting and great for a casual look. Very comfortable to wear. Rips are great for airflow and when it's warm, and add to flexibility and comfort of the jean. Also can be worn in cold weather.
